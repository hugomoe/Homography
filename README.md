# Homography
Aim : warping an image by an homography

Article - .tex of the article explaining the method used in code_decomp

code_decomp - the code to warp by an homography using a geometric decomposition, a method to resample by an affine map and an method to approximate 1D-Gaussian convolution

test_ground_truth - two programs to compare numerically the efficiency of code_decomp and of the Ripmap to a ground truth

Appendix - some functions, not directly linked with homographies (zooming-in by FFT, converting .pgm to .png, comparing subimages of two images)
